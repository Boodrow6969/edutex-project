# EDUTex Stakeholder Needs Analysis — Dynamic Sections
## Performance Problem, Compliance/Policy Change, Role Change/Expansion

**Document Purpose:** Dynamic section question sets for the three training types NOT yet validated against real-world use. These are v1 drafts grounded in Cathy Moore's Action Mapping, Mager's Performance Analysis, and the frameworks developed in earlier EDUTex design sessions. Flagged as UNTESTED — iterate when real projects surface.

**Note:** Static sections (Project Context, Audience, Rollout, Constraints, SMEs, Concerns) are identical across all types and documented in the New System spec. This document covers only the type-specific dynamic sections (equivalent to Sections 2-4 in the New System spec).

---

# TYPE 1: PERFORMANCE PROBLEM

**When to use:** Something is broken, inefficient, or underperforming. People are doing the work but not doing it well enough. There IS a current state to compare against.

**Key insight:** The stakeholder often arrives with "we need training on X." That's a solution masquerading as a problem. These questions force backward from the business impact to the actual root cause — which may or may not be a training problem.

---

## Section 2: The Problem [DYNAMIC — Performance Problem]

### PERF_01 — The Problem or Opportunity *
**Question:** What specific problem are you trying to solve, or what opportunity are you trying to capture?

**Guidance:** Describe the business situation driving this request. Focus on what's going wrong (or what opportunity exists), not on the training itself.

*Examples: "Customer satisfaction scores dropped 15% after the last product update," "We're losing deals because reps can't articulate the new pricing model," "Three safety incidents in the last quarter were caused by the same procedural error"*

> **Design rationale:** This is Cathy Moore's "Why are we doing this?" — establishing business problem, not training request. Feeds BNA Q1 and Design Strategy.

---

### PERF_02 — Current vs. Desired Performance *
**Question:** What are people doing now, and what should they be doing instead?

**Guidance:** Describe the gap in terms of what people actually *do* on the job. Try to be specific about actions, not just knowledge.

*Examples: "Currently: Reps quote prices from memory and often get it wrong. Desired: Reps use the pricing configurator and verify before quoting." / "Currently: Technicians skip the lockout/tagout step when they're in a hurry. Desired: Lockout/tagout is completed 100% of the time."*

> **Design rationale:** Performance gap in behavioral terms. "They don't understand X" is not a gap — it's a guess at cause. Observable behaviors feed task analysis and objective writing.

---

### PERF_03 — Business Impact *
**Question:** What is the measurable impact of this problem on the business?

**Guidance:** Help us understand the scale using numbers where possible. Think about costs, time, quality, customer impact, risk, or lost revenue.

*Examples: "$200K in billing errors this quarter," "Average handle time 40% above benchmark," "3 regulatory warnings in 12 months," "Employee turnover in this role is 2x the company average"*

> **Design rationale:** Quantified impact defines ROI story and feeds Kirkpatrick Level 4 evaluation. If they can't quantify, it may signal the problem isn't well-understood — that's a legitimate finding.

---

### PERF_04 — Root Cause Hypothesis *
**Question:** Why do you think people aren't performing as expected? What's getting in the way?

**Guidance:** Think broadly — it might not be a knowledge issue. Consider whether people have the right tools, clear expectations, enough time, proper feedback, or organizational support.

*Examples: "They were never trained on the updated procedure," "The old software made it easy — the new interface is confusing," "They know the process but skip steps under time pressure," "There's no consequence for doing it wrong, so people take shortcuts"*

> **Design rationale:** Mager's "could they do it if their life depended on it?" filter. Determines whether root cause is Environment, Knowledge, Skill, or Motivation. Non-training causes need non-training solutions — document as critical finding.

---

### PERF_05 — What Has Been Tried
**Question:** What has already been done to address this problem?

**Guidance:** List any steps already taken — training, coaching, new tools, process changes, communications, etc. Include what worked partially and what didn't.

*Examples: "Sent a reminder email but nothing changed," "Vendor did a 1-hour webinar but it was too high-level," "Updated the SOP but people aren't reading it," "First time addressing it formally"*

> **Design rationale:** Prevents recommending something that already failed. Reveals organizational appetite for solutions and whether previous training attempts were bad design vs. wrong solution.

---

### PERF_06 — Environmental / Non-Training Factors
**Question:** Are there factors outside of training that contribute to this problem?

**Guidance:** Training is often just one part of the solution. Are there other factors that need to be addressed alongside training for it to be effective? Be honest — identifying these now saves time and money later.

*Examples: "The software is slow and crashes frequently," "Managers don't reinforce the procedure," "There's no job aid at the point of work," "KPIs reward speed over accuracy, so people cut corners," "Staffing is too thin for people to follow the full process"*

> **Design rationale:** "Training as % of solution" question. Almost no performance problem is 100% solvable by training alone. Plants the seed with stakeholders and feeds Design Strategy's intervention mix.

---

## Section 3: Success Criteria [DYNAMIC — Performance Problem]

### PERF_07 — Success Metrics *
**Question:** How will you measure whether this problem has been solved? What specific metrics or observable changes would tell you the training worked?

**Guidance:** Think beyond "people completed the training." What business metric would improve? What would you see people doing differently?

*Examples: "Error rate drops from 15% to under 5%," "Customer satisfaction returns to pre-update levels," "Zero safety incidents of this type in the next 6 months," "Call resolution time decreases by 30%"*

> **Design rationale:** Measurable success criteria. Feeds Kirkpatrick Level 4 and evaluation plan. Replaces current form's vague "how will you know" question.

---

### PERF_08 — What Does "Fixed" Look Like? *
**Question:** If this problem were completely solved, what would you see happening differently on a typical day?

**Guidance:** Paint the picture. Walk us through what a typical day looks like when people are performing correctly.

*Examples: "Reps pull up the configurator for every quote, verify the pricing with the customer, and close the call in under 8 minutes," "Every technician completes lockout/tagout before maintenance, signs the log, and verifies with a buddy"*

> **Design rationale:** The positive vision — desired state in behavioral terms. Feeds learning objectives and scenario design. If stakeholder can describe this clearly, you have your target performance.

---

## Section 4: (Not applicable for Performance Problem)

Performance Problem doesn't have an equivalent to "What Users Need to Do" because that's essentially what PERF_02 and PERF_08 cover — the current vs. desired state IS the task definition.

---

### Performance Problem Total: 8 dynamic questions (6 required, 2 optional)

**UNTESTED** — No real-world PDF validation. Grounded in Cathy Moore Action Mapping and Mager Performance Analysis frameworks.

# TYPE 2: COMPLIANCE / POLICY CHANGE

**When to use:** A regulation, law, or internal policy requires training. The driver is external mandate, not performance gap. Deadlines are hard, consequences are defined by authority, and completion tracking is typically required.

**Key insight:** Compliance training has unique constraints — hard deadlines, attestation requirements, and consequences defined by external authority. The biggest risk is over-scoping (stakeholder anxiety leads to "train on everything") or under-designing (checkbox compliance that doesn't change behavior).

---

## Section 2: The Requirement [DYNAMIC — Compliance]

### COMP_01 — Regulation or Policy *
**Question:** What regulation, law, or policy is driving this training requirement?

**Guidance:** Provide the specific regulation, law, standard, or internal policy that requires this training. Include reference numbers or document names if available.

*Examples: "OSHA 29 CFR 1910.147 — Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout)," "HIPAA Privacy Rule — annual refresher," "Company Policy HR-2025-003: Updated Harassment Prevention," "SOX Section 404 — Internal Controls for finance team"*

> **Design rationale:** Get the specific citation, not just a general description. "OSHA requirements" is too vague. The actual regulatory text lets you verify what MUST be trained vs. what the stakeholder THINKS needs training.

---

### COMP_02 — What Changed *
**Question:** What specifically changed, and why does it require training?

**Guidance:** Describe what's new or different. Is this a new regulation, an update to an existing one, or an annual refresher on an unchanged policy?

*Examples: "New CFPB rule on overdraft fees takes effect July 1 — changes how we disclose fees to customers," "Company harassment policy was updated to include remote work scenarios," "Nothing changed — this is the required annual refresher on existing HIPAA procedures," "State added mandatory bystander intervention training to existing harassment prevention requirement"*

> **Design rationale:** Scope of change determines training scope. A narrowly updated clause is different from an entirely new regulation. "Nothing changed, annual refresher" shifts design toward reinforcement and assessment rather than new learning — fundamentally different instructional approach.

---

### COMP_03 — Required Behaviors *
**Question:** What specific actions must people take to comply? Are there things they must stop doing or avoid?

**Guidance:** List the concrete behaviors the regulation or policy requires. Think "must do" and "must not do."

*Examples: "Must verify customer identity using two forms of ID before processing any transaction over $10K," "Must report suspected data breaches to IT security within 24 hours," "Must not share login credentials under any circumstances," "Must document informed consent before any procedure"*

> **Design rationale:** Compliance training succeeds or fails on behavioral specificity. "Be aware of the policy" is not a behavior. "Report X to Y within Z hours" is. Each required behavior becomes a training objective and an assessment item.

---

### COMP_04 — Consequences of Non-Compliance *
**Question:** What are the consequences if people don't comply?

**Guidance:** Describe the consequences at both the organizational level (fines, lawsuits, license loss) and the individual level (disciplinary action, termination, personal liability). Include examples of past violations if available.

*Examples: "Organizational: Up to $50K per violation from the CFPB. Individual: Written warning, escalating to termination for repeat violations." / "Last year, two employees were terminated for sharing credentials — resulted in a data breach affecting 10K customer records." / "Audit findings from non-compliance go directly to the board — it's a career-limiting event for the department head."*

> **Design rationale:** Consequences determine design intensity. "Someone could get hurt" or "we lose our license" = realistic scenarios, rigorous assessment, manager reinforcement. "Minor audit finding" = awareness-level training. If the manager can't articulate consequences, the learners won't take it seriously either.

---

### COMP_05 — Compliance Verification *
**Question:** How will compliance be verified? Is there a required assessment, attestation, or audit process?

**Guidance:** Describe how the organization (or regulators) will verify that people are compliant. This includes any required testing, sign-offs, certifications, or audit procedures.

*Examples: "All employees must score 80% or higher on the annual assessment," "Managers must attest that their teams have completed training," "External auditors will sample records during the Q3 review," "Employees sign an acknowledgment that they've read and understood the policy," "Regulators require documented evidence of training completion within 30 days of hire"*

> **Design rationale:** Verification method drives assessment design. If there's a formal test, you design backward from it. If it's just attestation, you still need to ensure understanding (not just clicks). Audit criteria tell you what evidence you need to produce.

---

### COMP_06 — Scope and Exceptions
**Question:** Does this apply to everyone equally, or are there role-specific requirements, exemptions, or special cases?

**Guidance:** Tell us if different roles have different compliance requirements, if anyone is exempt, or if there are special cases.

*Examples: "Everyone must complete the general awareness module. Managers have an additional 30-minute module on reporting obligations." / "Applies to all customer-facing roles. Back-office staff are exempt." / "New hires must complete within 30 days. Existing employees have 90 days for the updated content."*

> **Design rationale:** Uniform vs. role-specific compliance determines whether you build one track or multiple. Exemptions and special cases prevent over-training. Deadlines by group affect the delivery schedule.

---

### COMP_07 — Previous Training / Existing Knowledge
**Question:** Have people been trained on this topic before? What do they already know?

**Guidance:** Tell us if this is their first exposure to this topic or if they've had prior training. If prior training exists, describe what it covered and how long ago it was.

*Examples: "Annual refresher — everyone completed this last year," "First time — the regulation is brand new," "They had a 1-hour overview 2 years ago but it was surface-level," "The BPO team has never received this training; internal staff completed it in 2024"*

> **Design rationale:** Prior training determines instructional starting point. Annual refresher on unchanged content needs reinforcement, not re-teaching. New regulation to people who already have related training needs a "here's what's different" approach.

---

## Section 3: Not applicable for Compliance

Compliance doesn't have a separate "business justification" section because the justification IS the regulation/policy (COMP_01) and its consequences (COMP_04). Separating them would feel redundant to stakeholders.

---

## Section 4: Not applicable for Compliance

Compliance doesn't have a separate "what users need to do" section because COMP_03 (required behaviors) covers this directly. The tasks ARE the compliance requirements.

**UNTESTED** — No real-world PDF validation. Grounded in compliance training best practices and regulatory design frameworks.

---
---

# TYPE 3: ROLE CHANGE / EXPANSION

**When to use:** People are taking on new responsibilities — promotion, lateral move, added duties, or organizational restructuring. The driver is capability building for a new or expanded role, not fixing broken performance or meeting a mandate.

**Key insight:** Role transitions involve identity shift, not just skill acquisition. There are existing capabilities to build on (unlike new system where everyone starts at zero) and an emotional/psychological dimension (confidence, imposter syndrome, peer relationship changes). The training approach is fundamentally different from the other three types.

---

## Section 2: The Change [DYNAMIC — Role Change]

### ROLE_01 — Nature of the Change *
**Question:** What is changing about these roles, and what's driving the change?

**Guidance:** Tell us what's changing and why. Is this a promotion, lateral move, new responsibilities being added, or a restructuring?

*Examples: "Individual contributors are being promoted to team lead positions," "Marketing coordinators are absorbing social media management from a disbanded team," "Customer service reps are being cross-trained for technical support," "Department merger — two teams with different processes need to align"*

> **Design rationale:** Type of change determines instructional approach. Promotions need leadership/soft skill development. Lateral moves need technical reskilling. Added responsibilities need targeted upskilling. Restructuring needs blend plus change management. Also reveals emotional context — welcome promotion vs. forced restructure.

---

### ROLE_02 — New Responsibilities *
**Question:** What specific new tasks, responsibilities, or decisions will these employees need to handle?

**Guidance:** List the new or expanded responsibilities as specifically as possible. Think about a typical week in the new role.

*Examples: "Conduct weekly 1:1 meetings, write quarterly performance reviews, approve PTO requests, handle first-level employee complaints" / "Create and manage social media content calendars, respond to customer inquiries on social channels, generate monthly engagement reports"*

> **Design rationale:** Task analysis seed. "They'll need to manage people" is too vague. What does "manage people" mean HERE? Each specific task becomes a training objective candidate.

---

### ROLE_03 — Current Capabilities *
**Question:** What relevant skills, knowledge, or experience do these employees already have?

**Guidance:** Describe what these employees already know or can do that's relevant to their new role. This helps us build on existing strengths rather than repeating what they already know.

*Examples: "They're technically strong — all have 3+ years as individual contributors. They know our products and processes. What they lack is formal people management skills." / "They understand basic social media as personal users, but have no experience with brand voice, scheduling tools, or analytics."*

> **Design rationale:** Defines the starting point so training targets the actual gap, not ground zero. Experienced professionals don't need to relearn the business — they need the NEW skills their new role demands. Also identifies adjacent existing skills that provide a head start.

---

### ROLE_04 — High-Stakes Decisions
**Question:** What are the most critical or high-stakes decisions people will face in the expanded role? Where would mistakes be most costly?

**Guidance:** Think about the decisions that would be hardest for someone new to the role. What situations would make them most nervous?

*Examples: "First time delivering negative feedback in a performance review," "Deciding when to escalate a technical issue vs. handle it themselves," "Approving budget requests they've never had authority over," "Handling a customer complaint that could become a legal issue"*

> **Design rationale:** Equivalent of the New System high-stakes question. Identifies where practice scenarios and simulations should focus. New-to-role people are most vulnerable at decision points they've never faced.

---

### ROLE_05 — Success Criteria *
**Question:** How will you evaluate whether someone is ready to perform in the expanded role? What does "proficient" look like?

**Guidance:** How will managers know that someone is ready? Is there a formal evaluation, or more informal?

*Examples: "Manager observation during a 2-week shadow period," "Must pass the team lead assessment with 80% or higher," "No formal evaluation — they start and we course-correct," "90-day probationary period with weekly check-ins and formal review at the end"*

> **Design rationale:** Shapes assessment strategy. "No formal evaluation" is a recommendation opportunity — suggest observable checkpoints, manager-observed simulations, or 30/60/90 day framework. If certification or formal assessment exists, build training backward from those requirements.

---

### ROLE_06 — Transition Timeline *
**Question:** When does this role change take effect, and what does the transition period look like?

**Guidance:** Will people move into the new role all at once, or gradually take on new responsibilities? Will they do both old and new duties during the transition?

*Examples: "Promotions are effective March 1 — they'll start managing their teams immediately," "Gradual handoff over 3 months — they'll shadow the outgoing person while maintaining their current workload," "They start Monday with no transition period," "Phased: month 1 they observe, month 2 they co-lead, month 3 they're fully independent"*

> **Design rationale:** Abrupt vs. gradual transition determines training urgency and format. "They start Monday" = survival-level training now with longer development to follow. 3-month transition allows blended learning with on-the-job practice. Also critical: are they doing BOTH roles during transition?

---

### ROLE_07 — Support and Mentoring
**Question:** What ongoing support, coaching, or mentoring will be available during and after the transition?

**Guidance:** Will they have a mentor, coach, or experienced peer to lean on? Is there a formal support structure or are they on their own?

*Examples: "Each new team lead will be paired with an experienced manager as a mentor for 6 months," "No formal mentoring — their manager will be their primary support," "We're setting up a peer cohort — all new leads will meet biweekly to share challenges," "The outgoing person will be available for questions for 30 days"*

> **Design rationale:** Support structure determines how self-sufficient the training needs to make people. Strong mentoring means training can focus on frameworks and concepts while mentors handle situational coaching. No support means training must be more comprehensive and include scenario-based decision practice.
